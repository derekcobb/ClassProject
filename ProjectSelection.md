For my project I have chosen to do the wedding vendor bidding application. My scope for the vendors will be tailors to work
on wedding gowns for the bride and tuxedos for the grooms. Ultimately, the bride and/or groom to be will be able to request
bids from a more diverse pool of vendors but the simplified scope is to allow the successful build of the application framework.
I chose the application for its simplicity and its potential to help those on the consumer side of the wedding industry. Since
the costs can get out of control rather quickly for young, soon to be newly weds, I hope that this can help scale costs back to
more sensible prices and help get business to reputable but less well known vendors in the wedding industry.

The data requirements for the scope of this project are simple. They consist of the user's basic contact information, measurements,
full body photo, any particulars about the outfit that should be in the final product, and the contact information of the vendors.
There may also be an area that shows the vendors that have been used the most in particular areas. Most of the information will be
tailored to the user's profile based on what is needed at that time. There will not be a need to hold much data except for showing
historical data for marketing purposes.

The application will need secure access for opening an account. There will not be a need to store much if any sensitive information
unless users and vendors want to pay over the application rather than in person. Photos will be need to be held but will be deleted
from the server after the event has taken place. There will need to be a way for vendors to look at the accounts that have open bids,
a way for the users to see who has looked at their profile and review bids, and a way for the vendors to know whether they have been
selected for services. Vendors that have not been selected will be notified too. Users and their selected vendors will be able to private
message each other to do business through the application when meeting in person is not viable. A record of communication will be digital
saved until the conclusion of the event has been confirmed. The information will be automatically be cleared from the user profile history
but the account will remain available should the user need to use it again.

Users will be able to access the application on their computers, tablets, or mobile phones. The initial interaction will be the basic
questions answered when creating a general account like with most other services. Key to this account creating will be the full bodied
photo. An account will not be complete until the user has submitted a full body photo of themselves. All of the actions will be accomplished
with push button commands and filling out short description boxes. All of that will be on the user's side. On the vendors side, a notification
will pop up alerting the vendor that a user in their area is looking for a bid on a wedding outfit. The vendor will be able to log in, see the
profile and decide whether they can meet the desires of the customer. Vendors will be able to see how many other vendors have submitted a bid
before they submit their own. They have the ability to send pictures of what they can do and either links to videos or embedded videos to the
customer to help win their business. Customers will be able to edit submitted pictures.

It is my hope that this application will help couples find more affordable prices for their wedding gowns and/or tuxedos. The application is
straight forward and simple enough to execute. Some challenges I see include preventing customers from submitting inappropriate pictures, connecting
customers with reputtable vendors, and establishing sound policies to protect the customers, vendors, and the application. Inspiration for the
application format comes from Etsy and eBay.
