 My name is Derek Cobb. I have a background in subsistence farming with my father when I was a child, 
developing budgeting spreadsheets for my family and myself since I was in middle school, and working on
two different battalion staffs for four years of my active duty service. My personal objectives are to create
an application that helps people in their day-to-day work life and personal life. The application I create needs
to add value to something in people's lives that many people would say is important but hard to adhere to regularly.
Three areas I want to focus on for an application include budgeting, subsistence farming, and staff operations.
I will also consider making a game application.
 
 The budgeting application will be to designed to do three things. First it would help people identify where they
are losing money. Secondly, it would analyze their regular spending and develop a proposed budget for the individual
to follow. Lastly, it would identify ares in which the user can learn about their finances. For example, it would
suggest things like health savings account to help lower medical expenses, give tax tips to consider for certain
situations, and simple investment options like CD laddering. Users would start up building an emergency fund if
they had not possessed one before and have the option of manually entering information or connecting their accounts.
Several of the proposals also center around a big event in many people's lives, which is a wedding.
 
 The gardening application would be focused on helping novice gardeners. It will take the desired plant(s) that a
gardener wants to grow, their geographical information, and soil type to determinte a timeline for caring for the plant.
The application will also make recommendations based off of informaiton collected from a local weather service. It will
also feature a database of helpful videos for troubleshooting gardening challenges such as dealing with pests, plant diseases,
and over watering. Applications such as *Gardening Companian* and and *Smart Plant* already do many of these tasks. An
additional feature would be to add an option to store an album of pictures that record the progress of the garden.

 For the staff officer there is the memorandum formattig application. This application would involve creating a database
of templates for specific types of memorandums, operations orders, letters, etc. for military purposes. Staff officers
and NCOs have to generate a lot of paper work. Since there is a high turnover rate of officers and senior NCOs, approved
formats end up getting lost due to frequent rotations and continuity books not being properly maintained. The application
would solve that by allowing the desired template to be downloaded onto the phone and then emailed to their account. There
are no applications like this for the military specifically to my knowledge.

 A simple idea for a wedding application involves providing specific knowledge help for a region. Based on the location
of the user or the planned area for the wedding information would be provided to the user concerning laws, local customs,
and the contact information of an officiant or a wedding planner. The user would be kept up-to-date on changing conditions
such as laws, taxes, and weather conditions for the upcoming event.

 Another idea for a wedding application involes simplifying the amount of traveling people do researching vendors for the
wedding dress. This application would require the user to take a full body length photo of themselves, clothed of course, and 
provide specific measurements. The information would be provided to vendors that make wedding dresses an tuxedos whether for
rental or purchase. Vendors would be able to provide a bid, pictures of their wares, and commentary on what they could offer.
Only the user would be able to see what each vendor offers. There would be a timer showing how much time vendors would have
to make an offer. Upon the user's decision, selected vendor(s) would be notified and the non-selected vendors would
receive a rejection notification. From the pool of selected vendors, the user would conduct further questioning until
finding the final one to conduct business with. It is similar to a reverse ETSY.

 The final idea is for a wedding game. For the game, players would be an up and coming wedding event planner known around
the world. The player would receive requests to plan wedding events for different people around the world. Each level would
consist of a picture of a well-known wedding location in that country that the player has to plan the event at. Information
would be given about customs and courtesies in that particular part of the world. The player would be given a budget and
an option of different things to select for several aspects of the wedding. Sucess would be determined by the number of correct
decorations selected for the wedding. Points and new contacts with discount would be given as a reward for each event.

 These ideas help attain my personal objectives by providing applications that can help people in their daily lives. In order to
build one of these applications I will need to build databases of images and other content. Testers will be required to give
outside input. I will also need to develop scripts with several options for choices. A fair amount of research will need to
be conducted for any of the proposed application to adhere to rules and laws.
